# 🐶 Pet Daycare Onboarding System – Project Preparation

## Project Goal
--- To improve the onboarding experience for, owners, employees and clients at the Pet Daycare. The aim is to reduce the employee onboarding duration, standardize the client onboarding process, and make the entire flow more intuitive for all users. ---

## 📌 1. Initial Observations
1) The owners are frustrated because onboarding new employees takes at least 3 months.
2) The employees are fristrated because the process of onboarding a new client is complicated. Each individual employee also has their own "flavor" when processing the incoming client.
3) The customers are frustrated because the onboarding flow is difficult to follow.

## 🧠 2. Assumptions
*These assumptions are to be validated during the the first meeting*
1) There is no standardized process for offboarding, which explains why each employee has their own approach.
2) There is little to no training provided to employees, which contributes to prolonged onboarding times and inconsistent approaches.
3) The onboarding process likely involves manual or paper-based steps, which contributes to extended onboarding durations.
4) Client onboarding likely relies on manual or paper-based processes, lacks clear status updates, and has an inefficient method for obtaining assistance.

## ❓ 3. Key Questions for the Client

### 🖥️ Platform & Client Interaction

1. Is your current platform digital, or are operations primarily paper-based?  
2. Is client information stored digitally or on paper?  
3. Do clients have a way to reach your staff or employees for assistance?
