# 🐶 Pet Daycare Onboarding System – Project Preparation

## 🎯 Project Goal
To improve the onboarding experience for owners, employees, and clients at the Pet Daycare. The aim is to reduce employee onboarding duration, standardize the client onboarding process, and make the entire flow more intuitive for all users.

---

## 📌 1. Initial Observations
1. The owners are frustrated because onboarding new employees takes at least 3 months.  
2. The employees are frustrated because the process of onboarding a new client is complicated. Each individual employee also has their own "flavor" when processing an incoming client.  
3. The customers are frustrated because the onboarding flow is difficult to follow.

---

## 🧠 2. Assumptions
*These assumptions are to be validated during the first meeting:*

1. There is no standardized process for offboarding, which explains why each employee has their own approach.  
2. There is little to no training provided to employees, which contributes to prolonged onboarding times and inconsistent approaches.  
3. The onboarding process likely involves manual or paper-based steps, contributing to extended onboarding durations.  
4. Client onboarding likely relies on manual or paper-based processes, lacks clear status updates, and has an inefficient method for obtaining assistance.

## ❓ 3. Key Questions for the Client

### 🖥️ Platform & Client Interaction
1. Is your current platform digital, or are operations primarily paper-based?  
2. Is client information stored digitally or on paper?  
3. Do clients have a way to reach your staff or employees for assistance?

### 👥 Employee Onboarding Process
4. Can you walk me through the current steps involved in onboarding a new employee, from start to finish?  
5. Is there a dedicated team responsible for training new employees?

### 🎯 Employee Autonomy & Consistency
6. Which areas of the onboarding process allow employees the freedom to "do as they please"?  
7. Which aspects of the onboarding process currently allow employees to follow their own methods or approaches?

### 💬 Feedback & Pain Points
8. How do you currently collect and manage feedback from employees and customers regarding your onboarding processes?  
9. What do clients complain about the most?  
10. What do employees complain about the most?

### 🛠️ Tools & Process Standardization
11. Are there any software tools currently used during onboarding, or is the process fully manual?  
12. Have you ever considered standardizing or automating parts of the onboarding process?

---

## 🔁 4. Follow-Up Clarification Questions
1. What does a successfully onboarded client or employee look like?  
2. Is the daycare interested in automating notifications via email or text?  
3. Are there any legal statutes or regulations that need to be considered, given that pets are involved?

---

## ✅ 5. Draft Requirements (To Be Validated)
1. Develop standardized onboarding workflows for:
   - New employees  
   - New clients (including pet information)  
2. Design an internal dashboard for tracking onboarding progress  
3. Create digital intake forms for client/pet information  
4. Allow for automated client notifications (email/SMS)  
5. Provide employees with step-by-step guidance and training  
6. Include admin oversight tools for process consistency, including:  
   - Monitoring how onboarding is progressing for employees and clients  
   - Ensuring that all employees are following the same standardized onboarding procedures  
   - Identifying bottlenecks or inconsistencies in the onboarding steps  
   - Alerting when employees deviate from the standardized onboarding process
